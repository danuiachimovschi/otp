# OTP Library

This project is an OTP (One-Time Password) library implemented in Go. It supports both HOTP (HMAC-based One-Time Password) and TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) algorithms. The library provides functions to generate and validate OTPs, making it suitable for implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) in applications.

## Features

- **HOTP**: Generate and validate HMAC-based OTPs.
- **TOTP**: Generate and validate time-based OTPs.

## Installation

To install the library, use the following command:

```sh
go get github.com/danuiachimovschi/otp
